## Reference

If you find this code useful or use it in an academic or research project, please cite it as: 
Frédéric Bousefsaf, Alain Pruski, Choubeila Maaoui, **Continuous wavelet filtering on webcam photoplethysmographic signals to remotely assess the instantaneous heart rate**, *Biomedical Signal Processing and Control*, vol. 8, n° 6, pp. 568–574 (2013).


## Scientific description

Please refer to the original publication to get all the details. Two main contributions were proposed:
- A skin detection that allows selection of pixels of interests.
- A filtering procedure based on the continuous wavelet representation of the iPPG signal.


## Requirements
The codes were developped and tested in C# with OpenCV v.2.4.88888888888 and in Matlab.
